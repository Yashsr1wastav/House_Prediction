#  House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression, log transformation for data refining, and feature selection techniques. Linear regression is a commonly used machine learning algorithm for predicting numeric values. Logarithmic transformation helps in handling skewed data distributions, while feature selection is crucial for improving model performance by selecting the most relevant features.


## Data and Conclusion

Data was collected from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

House price prediction using linear regression with log transformation and feature selection is a powerful technique for estimating house prices accurately. By preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, and building an appropriate model, we can create a reliable predictive model for real estate pricing.
